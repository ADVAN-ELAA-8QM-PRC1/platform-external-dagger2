 * A hook for monitoring the execution of individual {@linkplain Produces producer methods}. See

 *
 * <p>The lifecycle of the monitor is:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #methodStarting}
 *   <li>The method is called
 *   <li>{@link #methodFinished}
 *   <li>If the method returns a value, then:
 *   <ul>
 *     <li>{#succeeded} if the method returned normally; or
 *     <li>{#failed} if the method threw an exception.
 *   </ul>
 *   <li>If the method returns a future, then:
 *   <ul>
 *     <li>{#succeeded} if the method returned normally, and the future succeeded; or
 *     <li>{#failed} if the method threw an exception, or returned normally and the future failed.
 *   </ul>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>If any of the monitor's methods throw, then the exception will be logged and processing will
 * continue unaffected.
